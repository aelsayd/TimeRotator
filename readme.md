### Reason
So the reason behind making this sketch was to check whether velocity based time travel works as I expected it to. Now, I got a bit carried away and ended up making a fork of the sketch that generated vapor-wave like art which had, imo, a very cool and unique style.

### Results
The results are kind of mixed, which is rather unfortunate, as time travel did not work as I expected it to. This may mean that I would have to think about a better theory to apply, but in a very short manner, my results were as follows:

* There are *indeterminate states* which a particle can reach in its lifetime, and that occurs if it hits a singularity in the equation whose where -v = +v, ie: at v = 0; When a particle reaches such a state, it cannot "go back" which means that other particles that were causally dependant on it would be affected. 
* I have also seen another trend where the particle goes in the same general direction at non zero v, which kind of bugs me. In a spiraling vector field, the particels always seem to go *outwards* regardless of their sign, which only affects the direction of rotation. This is probably because of problems with approximation, should try using doubles and see if the problem persists. EDIT: didn't work, which makes me think that the problem is not with approximation, but with the nature of this particular equation.  

* Other than that, there were no problems. Which limits the effect of the problem to:
	* The way the numena interact
	* What kind of equations are allowed

If equations with singularities are avoided, the problem should not persist. In other words, a velocity of 0 cannot be non-causally obtained by an entity.
